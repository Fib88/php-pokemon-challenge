# php-pokemon-challenge

Same challenge as the javascript pokemon challenge.
https://github.com/Fib88/ajax-pokedex


This time we can only use php.

I'm trying to get my evolutions to work right now.

### Update:
Got my evolutions on the page.
What I want to do next:
    
    * error handling for when pokemon only have 1 move
    * show evo images instead of the names
